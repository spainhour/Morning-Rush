# Morning-Rush
The final project I made for my introductory Computer Science class, Morning Rush, is a text-based adventure created with Python.

Upon waking up one morning before school, you are tasked to explore the house in search of your toothbrush so you can brush your teeth. Be careful though! You never know what could be waiting for you behind every turn.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commands:

Moving through the house: 
'go north', 
'go south', 
'go east', 
'go west'

Picking up/Using items: 
'take [item name]', 
'use [item name]'

Try using other commands as well!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program was developed with Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).
To run: Use the terminal to navigate to the directory Morning Rush is in, then type 'python2 MorningRush.py'
